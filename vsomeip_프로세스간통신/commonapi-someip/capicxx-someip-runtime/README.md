##### Build Instructions for Linux

###### vsomeip

In order to build the CommonAPI SOME/IP Runtime library the vsomeip library must be available on your system. Please consult the vsomeip documentation for informations on building vsomeip.

###### Build CommonAPI-SomeIP Runtime

Use CMake to build the CommonAPI SOME/IP runtime library. We assume that your source directory is common-api-someip-runtime:

```bash
$ cd common-api-someip-runtime
$ mkdir build
$ cmake -D USE_INSTALLED_COMMONAPI=ON -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
$ make
$ make install
```

You can change the installation directory by the CMake variable _CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX_ or you can let it uninstalled (skip the _make install_ command). If you want to use the uninstalled version of CommonAPI set the CMake variable _USE_INSTALLED_COMMONAPI_ to _OFF_.

For further build instructions (build for windows, build documentation, tests etc.) please refer to the CommonAPI SOME/IP tutorial.
